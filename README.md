## ‚ú® Why CDC Boost-Service?
Deploying the Oracle XStream CDC Source Connector can be complex.  
Every Oracle environment is different ‚Äî from version compatibility to database privileges and table-level design.  

CDC Boost-Service reduces this complexity by:
- Collecting requirements upfront
- Automating evaluation with SQL scripting
- Providing a recommended CDC solution design (tables, flows, DB changes, sizing)

## üõ´ The Flight Journey

The journey is prepared and ready to execute:

### 1. Pre-Flight
Customers answer a **short questionnaire** and run a **SQL script**.  
This gives Confluent the details needed about the Oracle environment (e.g., DB version, privileges, redo log setup, replication capabilities).

**Outcome:** Clear overview of Oracle requirements.

### 2. In-Flight
Confluent prepares a **detailed evaluation** based on the Pre-Flight data.  
This includes:
- Scripting for environment checks
- Compatibility validation
- Identifying required configuration changes

**Outcome:** A ready-to-use evaluation package that simplifies the customer‚Äôs preparation.
